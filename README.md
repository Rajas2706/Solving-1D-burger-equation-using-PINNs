# üß† PINN for Solving 1D Burgers' Equation

This project implements a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** using TensorFlow to solve the 1D **viscous Burgers' equation**, a classical nonlinear partial differential equation. It also includes a **Streamlit web app** to compare the PINN solution against the analytical solution.

## üî¨ About Burgers' Equation

The 1D viscous Burgers' equation is:

‚àÇu/‚àÇt + u ‚àÇu/‚àÇx = ŒΩ ‚àÇ¬≤u/‚àÇx¬≤

## üß™ About
> The PINN model learns the solution 
u(t,x) of the Burgers' equation:

 ### ‚àÇu/‚àÇt + u ‚àÇu/‚àÇx = ŒΩ ‚àÇ¬≤u/‚àÇx¬≤
 >where ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity. The neural network is trained with physics constraints encoded as loss functions to satisfy the PDE, initial and boundary conditions.
