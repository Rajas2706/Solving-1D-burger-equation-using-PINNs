# ðŸ§  PINN for Solving 1D Burgers' Equation

This project implements a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** using TensorFlow to solve the 1D **viscous Burgers' equation**, a classical nonlinear partial differential equation. It also includes a **Streamlit web app** to compare the PINN solution against the analytical solution.

## ðŸ”¬ About Burgers' Equation

The 1D viscous Burgers' equation is:

âˆ‚u/âˆ‚t + u âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x = Î½ âˆ‚Â²u/âˆ‚xÂ²
